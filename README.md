# pass-your-story-on
A web app to play pass your story on.

The current live prototype is at https://pass-your-story-on.herokuapp.com/

## How it works:

Each player writes the beginning of a story until the timer runs out. Then their story gets passed to the next player who reads through it and then has the same amount of time to continue the narrative. Once the story has been passed to all participants, the players can view the completed stories.
